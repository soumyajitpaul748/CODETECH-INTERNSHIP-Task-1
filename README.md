Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a simple and user-friendly To-Do List application that helps users manage their tasks efficiently. The app is built using fundamental web technologiesâ€”HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Users can input tasks into a text box and add them to the list by clicking the "Add" button.
Task Management:
Tasks are displayed in a list format (<ul>), with potential options to mark them as complete, delete them, or edit them (based on further enhancements).
Interactive UI:
The app provides a clean, responsive, and visually appealing interface.
Technology Stack:
HTML: Provides the structure of the app, including the input field, button, and task list.
CSS: Handles styling, ensuring the app looks organized and visually appealing.
JavaScript: Adds interactivity, such as:
Adding tasks to the list dynamically.
Implementing task-related functionalities (e.g., marking as complete).
Future Enhancements:
Allow users to delete individual tasks.
Add a feature to edit tasks.
Use localStorage to save tasks so they persist across browser sessions.
Enhance the UI/UX with animations and better styling.
This project is ideal for beginners learning to integrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a functional web app. It provides hands-on experience with DOM manipulation and event handling.
